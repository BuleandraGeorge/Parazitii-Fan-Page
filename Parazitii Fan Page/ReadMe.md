<h1>Parazitii Fan Page</h1>

<p>The purpose of the project is to present a brief story of the Parazitii Band more exacly; how the band took form,
who are the members of the band and their stories, discography, a list of coming events, 
contact details for setting an event and a feedback section to share your Parazitii experience.<br>

All of that, supported with pictures, links to their shops where you can purchase thier discography, 
tickets to their events or other staff.
</p>

<h1>UX</h1>
<p>
The webside is made for teenagers over 16 years old that wants to find couple thinks about the band and its 
members and for old fans who want to purchase disks, tickets and other staff, to get in touch with the band 
or to share their experience.<br>
So due to the brief story of the band and the members and due to the links, contact details and feedback 
box provided they can achieve all of the goals mentioned above very fast due to the navigation bar and the hamburger menu implemented.
</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<p>
The website have different features from links to navbar and hamburger menu that helps the user to achieve different goals mentioned above.
<h2>Existing Features</h2>
<p>
Some of them are:<br>
Nav-bar and hambuger menu - allows users that wants to find the contact details from the bottom of the website page with just 2 clicks without scrolling the entire website.<br>
More than that the hambuger-menu is placed at the right bottom of the mobiles screen to be easier to be reached by mobile users.<br>
Events section - allows users that want to find coming events, to know where is next event by just surfing there easy due to the navigations features provided and have
a look on the list displayed and more than that, to buy a ticket throughout the link provided to the official tickets website.<br>
Links - links to their official tickets and disks shops.
</p>

<h2>Features Left to Implement</h2>
<p>
For the near future I want to implement a shopping cart for tickets and disks and a forum where fans can discuss different hip-hop topics.
</p>
<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<p>
To build this website I have used html and css and a drop of javascript to display that modal with text: "Thank you for your feedback" as feedback for submit.
</p>
<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>
To test the website I have used https://validator.w3.org/ to test the html code and https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ to test the css code. <br>
To test the website responsiveness I have used Google Chrome's developer tool and I have asked all my friends to enter on the website from different
devices that they have and to tell me how is it displayed, if there is any errors or any displaying errors, 
and to send me print screen.
</p>
<p>
To test the feedback form I have submitted the empty form and I have verified that if an error message about the required fields appears.<br>
And then I have tryied to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears.<br>
And finally I have submitted the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.<br>
</p>
<h2>About the responsiveness</h2>
<p>
On the mobile screen:<br>
I have chosen to display the hamburger menu in the right bottom of the screen to be easier for mobile users
to reached it.<br> 
The informations and pictures are displayed one beneath another because I want that the pictures and the wrote to be easy to be seen.<br><br>
For tablets same displaying method is keeped as on mobile<br><br>
For displays bigger than 1024 pixels I have chosen to add a navigation bar in top of the screen that is fixed so you can jump from section to another
whenever you want<br><br>
The social links that on the mobile screen are icons become wrote for a better look on desktop-displays.<br>
And because on the desktop screen sections would be too big one beneath another
I have chosen to display paires of two sections for eg: discography and events next to each other and the member boxes to be displayed in line.<br>
I have noticed that the Hero Image seems to be too small on different widths of the displaying devices, I have added some media querries but there are stil some problems and
sometimes the link to the styling file is not working properly so the website becomes a bunch of text.
</p>
<h1>Deployment</h1>
<p>
First I did the project in Sublime text editor and when I have uploaded on GitHub, the pictures didn't work, I have tried different ways to write the path but no succes so i have chosen to put 
the link from the official source.
</p>
<p>
